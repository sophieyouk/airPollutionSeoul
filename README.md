# Air Pollution in Seoul (updating)
### Background
I obtained data on the website Kaggle _Air Pollution in Seoul_ https://www.kaggle.com/bappekim/air-pollution-in-seoul. Seoul Metropolitan Government (SMG) has collected and provided many public data including air pollution information. There are several stations measuring air pollution in South Korea including Seoul.

### Data
**Variables:**
* Measurement date: Measurement date and time
* Station code: Measuring station code
* Address: Address of measuring station
* Latitude: Latitude of address
* Longitude: Longitude of address
* SO<sub>2</sub>: Sulfur dioxide
* NO<sub>2</sub>: Nitrogen dioxide
* O<sub>3</sub>: Ozone
* CO: Carbon monoxide
* PM<sub>10</sub>: Particulate matter 10 micrometers or less in diameter
* PM<sub>2.5</sub>: Particulate matter 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter; generally fine particles

The 25 mearing stations in Seoul has measured air pollutants (SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, CO, PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>) hourly. I use data by 8 hours since I couldn’t run the full dataset in my computer. Datasets are from 12 AM on 1 January 2017 to 11 PM on 31 December 2019. Every station has its own code (101 to 125). Address, latitude, and longitude indicate where the stations are located.

### Problem
I would like to focus on the data of four air pollutants and the relationship with PMs, and further, how they are related to the location (latitude, longitude, address, or stations code) and time (measurement date). Since the air pollution around the world is neither trivial nor temporary issue, researching air pollution data of Seoul can related to similar issues in other places, especially cities.

## Model
* Multivariate Regression Model 1
  * Responses: SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, CO, PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>
  * Predictors: Measurement date, Station code, Latitude, Longitude
* Multivariate Regression Model 2
  * Responses: PM<sub>10</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>
  * Predictors: SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, CO

### Method
* Exploratory Data Analysis
  * Plot each of 4 air pollutants vs. PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub>
* Clustering
  * Use weekly data since I couldn’t run the full dataset in my computer
  * Focus on SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, CO pollutants

### Remarkable Plots
* Figure 3: SO<sub>2</sub> vs. PM<sub>10</sub> & PM<sub>2.5</sub>
* Figure 4: NO<sub>2</sub> vs. PM<sub>10</sub> & PM<sub>2.5</sub>
* Figure 4: O<sub>3</sub> vs. PM<sub>10</sub> & PM<sub>2.5</sub>
* Figure 4: CO vs. PM<sub>10</sub> & PM<sub>2.5</sub>

### Conclusion
* Only NO<sub>2</sub> out of other pollutants and PMs was positively related to latitude
  * NO<sub>2</sub> values were recorded higher in northern counties
* SO<sub>2</sub> was negatively related to PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> values
  * When SO<sub>2</sub> values were high, values of PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> were recorded low
* 51 datasets have very high PM<sub>10</sub> values higher than approximately 2,000
  * According to the code information, four stations (116, 117, 121, and 122) are located southern or southwestern part of Seoul

### Discussion
* One county has only one measuring station
  * but the size, population, and number of factories are very various and random
* Counties with high density of population and factories may have higher air pollutants values than other counties even though they have fewer population and factories in reality
* More information of predictors/factors can improve analyzing the air pollution data
* Rain sometimes decreases the air pollution measurements
  * Better to analyze data collected in the same condition of weather
